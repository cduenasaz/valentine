          Your gift is a reservation to north and its me of course. I love you so much my baby princess and I will never stop loving you. I know this a little too geeky for you but I like to do things like this, afterall, its apart of my major (ECE: Eletrical Computer Engineering, Electrical is for hardware and the Computer is software). I am so excited to spend valentines day with you my first and (pray) only love as I want to show my appreciation for you so freaking badly. I'm lowkey very tight on money right now because of not working due to 
          school, lifestyle, family issues, social life, and other issues that take my time away to work. Just like the $14 sushi, I put all my remaining dollars (aside from the money i need for bills) on you to make your life easier and better because I will always put you first 💖. You make me so much happier and a better man than I was before
          always pushing me to do improve and always supporting me no matter what, it's what makes you so unique Lola. My family has told me since we started dating, I have matured and increased my emotional intelligence and I give all credit to you because you make me the happiest man ever. Even if i'm fat now with all the happy fat.
          This is only a fraction of what I have to say and you'll see the rest on our day. Ok I lowkey don't wanna spoil the rest but I love yapping so much about you that I gotta chill fr. I'm locking in to stop myself from saying how amazing, beautiful, unique u r cuz this will just turn into a yappathon. On yonks, I'm done this time. I love you, urs truly, Chris.
